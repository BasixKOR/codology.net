# MIT 6.001 - SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: Notes and solutions

This site contains my notes and answers to the exercices of the textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, usually just refered to as "SICP". The book has its origins in the popular MIT's entry-level comÂ­puter science course "[MIT 6.001 introductory course in computer science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)" taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, starting in 1980.

The second edition of the book, published in 1996, has been licensed under a Creative Commons License by MIT Press and can be downloaded freely (see links at bottom of this page). The videos of the original course have also been made public by MIT. Since the videos are based on the first edition of the book, and I am following the second edition, some discrependency will occure if you follow along.

In my opinion, the strength of the book is in its ability to introduce many fundamental topics in computer science and engineering, in a well organized way.

> SICP was revolutionary in many different ways. Most importantly, it dramatically raised the bar for the intellectual content of introductory computer science. Before SICP, the first CS course was almost always entirely filled with learning the details of some programming language. SICP is about standing back from the details to learn big-picture ways to think about the programming process. It focused attention on the central idea of abstraction -- finding general patterns from specific problems and building software tools that embody each pattern. It made heavy use of the idea of functions as data, an idea that's hard to learn initially, but immensely powerful once learned.

  * "It changed the way I look at the fundamental structure of programs. It is possible, and desirable, to write code without assignement statements as much as possible. To not mutate the states of variables. And it forces you to think about software in a very different way. [...] I assign now variable less frequently."
  * "[functional programming] forces you to keep your data in much better order. There will always be times when you have to change the state of the system but you do so with a tremendous amount of discipline in this language. You treat the changing of data in the system the way you would treat a transaction on disk."
