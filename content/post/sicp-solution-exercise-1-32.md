## Exercise 1.32

> Show that sum and product (Exercise 1.31) are both special cases of a still more general notion called `accumulate` that combines a collection of terms, using some general accumulation function:
> 
> ```scheme
>    (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
> ```
> 
> Accumulate takes as arguments the same term and range specifications as sum and product, together with a combiner procedure (of two arguments) that specifies how the current term is to be combined with the accumulation of the preceding terms and a null-value that specifies what base value to use when the terms run out. Write accumulate and show how sum and product can both be defined as simple calls to accumulate.
> 
> If your accumulate procedure generates a recursive process, write one that generates an iterative process. If it generates an iterative process, write one that generates a recursive process.

## Solution

The code can be derived easily from the `sum` and `sum-iter` developed in the previous exercise:

```scheme
(define (accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      null-value
      (combiner (term a)
         (accumulate combiner null-value term (next a) next b))))

(define (accumulate-iter combiner null-value term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if (> a b)
        result
        (iter (next a) (combiner result (term a)))))
  (iter a null-value))
```

Based on this definition, we can define the `sum` and `sum-iter` functions:

```scheme
(define (sum term a next b)
  (accumulate + 0 term a next b))

(define (sum-iter term a next b)
  (accumulate-iter + 0 term a next b))

(define (product term a next b)
  (accumulate * 1 term a next b))

(define (product-iter term a next b)
  (accumulate-iter * 1 term a next b))
```
